## 0.24.14618 Patch

`2025-09-25 14:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Season 4!
  - Season 4: Dawn of War is here!
  - This season comes with new cards and their new border design. Every new card also has exclusive lore for you to discover.
  - This new season also brings a whole new gameplay, with more dynamic effects.
  - The whole app has received a new style with improved UX experience, notably: the Product and card details, the opening, the shop.
  - The last big improvement are the improved rewards, through the new unlocker system, daily missions, and shop content.
  - Let's dive in!
- Cards
  - All Cards have received a new improved border, integrating card name, artist and complete numbering. It allows us to only keep important information when dueling.
- Gameplay
  - The point system has been replaced with a health system. Both players start with 25,000 Health points. The goal is to reduce the opponent's health to 0.
  - Players inflict damage to the opponent at the end of their turn up to the sum of the power of the cards you control.
  - Special Abilities are replaced by Blasts. Blasts are abilities attached to a deck. Each collection has 3 Blast divided into 3 levels. You will have to select a Blast of each level to play a deck. You can only play one Blast of each level per turn.
  - Each level of Blast has different effects, different energy costs, different max uses. After a Blast is played, there is no capture retry if cards are moved.
  - We added an Energy system for playing cards and Blasts. You start with 650 energy and regain 500 energy at the start of each turn starting at turn 3. The cost to play a card is equal to its power. You can't have more than 1200 Energy at any time. The surplus is lost.
  - You can play several cards per turn as long as you have enough energy.
  - You can discard cards to regain energy. The first discard each turn gives you 25 Energy, the second gives 75 and every discard after gives 150.
  - You can have as many field cards as you like in your deck. Field cards don't cost energy to play. Field cards last for 3 turns and empower its element by the amount of power of the card. Only one field can be active at a time.
  - We removed the Trinity system. (But affinity remains).
  - We removed the double advantage/disadvantage in the heptagram. Now an element is only strong against 1 other and weak against another. Also changed the order of the Heptagram to keep it logical.
  - Captures are only made with a chain of 1.
  - If a card on the board drops to 0 power or less, it is destroyed.
  - You can have a maximum of 10 cards in your hand at any time. If you draw an 11th card, it is destroyed.
  - Players have 90 seconds to play their turn. If you don't play during your turn, your turn ends automatically. For your next turn you will have only 450 seconds to play your turn. If you don't play during your turn, your turn ends automatically. For your next turn you will have only 45 seconds to play your turn. If you don't play during that turn, you lose the duel. Playing something during a turn with reduced time puts back your turn duration at 90 seconds.
  - Win conditions are: 
    - Reduce opponent's health to 0,
    - The opponent doesn't have a card in his deck and has to draw,
    - The board is filled and player has more health than the opponent,
    - The opponent didn't play within the allowed time 3 times in a row.
  - First card immunity
    - To protect the first card played from being captured, we added an immunity to captures for the first card played during 1 turn. The card is not immune to Blasts usage.
  - Blasts
    - Fireball, tied to Heritage Arkhante set
      - Level 1 (50 energy): Permanently weakens a card by -200 power.
      - Level 2 (100 energy, 3 charges): Permanently weakens a card by -200 power. Opponent's cards on adjacent squares each lose -100 power permanently.
      - Level 3 (200 energy, 1 charge): Destroys a card. All other opponent's cards on the board lose -200 power permanently.
    - Drone Command, tied to Heritage Mantris set
      - Level 1 (75 energy): Allows you to move a card on the board to a different occupied location. The two cards swap positions.
      - Level 2 (200 energy, 3 charges): Allows you to move a card on the board to a different free location.
      - Level 3 (250 energy, 1 charge): Allows you to move a card on the board to a different occupied location. The card occupying that location is then returned to its owner's hand. If the owner's hand is full, the card is destroyed.
    - Hack, tied to Watch Dogs set
      - Level 1 (25 energy): You can view your opponent's hand.
      - Level 2 (150 energy, 2 charges): You can view your opponent's hand and destroy one card from their hand.

    - Gravitational Wave, tied to Heritage Rift set
      - Level 1 (75 energy): Unleashes a wave of energy on a row or column which pushes the first card encountered in that direction one cell. If the card cannot be moved, it loses -100 power.
      - Level 2 (100 energy, 3 charges): Throw an energy ball onto a cell on the board, which pushes all adjacent cards outwards by one cell. If a card cannot be moved, it loses -100 power.
      - Level 3 (250 energy, 1 charge): Launch a wave from the edge of the board to move all the cards on the board by one cell. If a card cannot be moved, it is destroyed.
    - Draw of Fate, tied to Dawn of War set
      - Level 1 (100 energy): Draw 1 card without triggering overdraw.
      - Level 2 (150 energy, 3 charges): Look at the top 3 cards of your deck, then reorder them.
      - Level 3 (200 energy, 1 charge): Choose an element and draw 1 card. If the card matches the chosen element, you may play it for free on the board or burn it to repeat this action once. If not, you don't lose any charge and add the card to your hand without triggering the over-draw.
  - Runes
    - Runes introduce unique passive effects tied to collections, activated upon placement or while the card remains in play. These automatic effects are exclusive to S-grade cards (Static or Eternal) and are tied to the cardâ€™s collection (e.g., Isalys will always be Explosive 1, while Solis S will always be Mage 1). Each rune in the game (1 effect per collection) exists in 3 levels.
    - Combo Rules: Effects combine based on the following rules:
      - Each S alternate card: Level 1 effect of its collection.
      - An S combo made with two alternates of the same collection: Level 2 effect.
      - An S combo made with different collections: Level 1 effect for each collection.
      - An S combo made with three alternates of the same collection: Level 3 effect.
