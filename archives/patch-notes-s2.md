`2024-04-10 06:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Raid
  - The Event Exclusive cards rewarded in Raids are now replaced with a Shard.
    - You will need 20 Shards to create an Exclusive card from the event.
    - The Shard can create a Kunesh (Standard or Alternative), Gamar (Standard or Alternative) or Kunesh & Gamar card randomly following those odds: 70% Standard, 25% Alternative, 5% Combo; 50/50 between Kunesh and Gamar for Standard and Alternative.
    - You will receive at least 1 shard for each raid boss if you have been active and the boss was defeated. Based on the tier of the boss, the odds or the amount of rewards are increased.
  - Exclusive Shards, Event points and the chance to get a card pack are now increased based on your position in the damage leaderboard, example:
    - If you are in the top 1% of the damage Leaderboard, you will receive 100% more Shards and Event points as well as increasing the odds to get a Static Card Pack by 100%.
    - If you are in the top 50% of the damage Leaderboard, you will receive 50% more Shards and Event points as well as increasing the odds to get a Static Card Pack by 50%.

    - And so on...

## 0.22.9073 Patch

`2024-03-27 14:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Gameplay
  - Heptagram simplification
    - We want to simplify how we talk about the Heptagram. We have therefore chosen to group Arkhomes and Techstyles (as well as upcoming Tribes) under a common name "Elements".
    - These Elements have an updated name and icon.
    - In case we were talking about a specific Arkhome or Techstyle, we now use the Faction to complete the Element in order to differentiate them. (ie: to talk about Robotic, we may say Mantris Earth)
  - Updated board
    - The board was starting to have too many effects and movements.
    - It has been redesigned to be much simpler and easier to see.
    - We removed field animations and replaced it with a much simpler flow around the board.
    - We will continue to update it with new affinities effects in the future for example.
  - Card frame update
    - Card frames have been re-designed to emphasize important information for the gameplay.
    - You'll find the Faction in the top left corner, the Element in the top right corner, the Reinforcement level in the bottom left corner, and the Leader icon in the bottom right corner. The state of the card (static, flex, eternal with animation level or numbering) is indicated at the top of the card.
  - New Alliance system
    - Alliances are a new system introduced in duels around factions. An Alliance activates when two adjacent cards from the same Element but different factions are controlled by the same player. An alliance gives 1 reinforcement to both cards.

  - Two new ranks have been added: **Gladiator** and **Champion**. Among the Diamond players, the top 10 will be Champion rank and the next 100 will be Gladiator.
  - Rewards have been revamped and weekly rewards are now common to all members of the same rank. The following rewards will be distributed in total for the era:

  - The way we display the leaderboard is being reworked to better show the different rewards for your rank directly in game. Stay tuned!
  - The distribution is split based on the week, weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 are normal weeks. Weeks 3 and 5 are super weeks. Last week will be the most generous of all weeks.
  - The number of duels required to qualify for weekly rewards has been increased, and depends on your rank:
    - Champion, Gladiator and Diamond: 30 duels,
    - Platinum: 15 duels,
    - Gold: 7 duels,
    - Silver: 5 duels,
    - Bronze: 3 duels.
  - Update the formula of rating gain, you basically can now climb (and fall) 2 times faster than before until you are Diamond ~100pts.

  - Finishing your weekly missions gives you up to 7 reward packs, you can now claim 1, 2 and 4 reward packs at each threshold for a total of 70 cards up from 15 cards.
  - End of duel packs are now reward packs, but still have to go through the unlocker first. The packs contain 10 cards up from 2 cards and takes 12 hrs to unlock up from ~4.5 hours.
  - Weekly dungeons now give up to 7 reward packs based on the number of stars you achieve for a total of 70 cards up from 12 cards.

      - Unlocker
        - You now have a number of locked packs you can **store** when your unlocker is full, up to 8 slots (with a Sapphire relic).
        - We also **reduced** the number of **unlock slot** available, removing the level 20 slot and the 50 unlock slot, from 6 to 4 maximum (with a Sapphire relic).
      - Inventory
        - Show all **chests, packs, pranah bundle, free mint, mint pass** you have. You can better see each of these items individually, see all odds related to each chests, ...

    - Bonus Trisel in reward packs (up to 77 based on relic),
    - Reductions in energy refill cost increase (up to 400 based on relic),
    - They now last **15 days** and are available in **three tiers** that offers those bonuses but at different degrees.
- Eternal
  - As previously discussed, we decided to change the way we manage **numbering** in the early moments of the release of new cards (pack opening, new crafts available, exclusive cards from events, ...) to be more fair to everyone.
  - With this update, for a **few days** following the release of new cards, the creation of a new Eternal card will not allocate a number at first but instead, register the creation in a pool. At the end of the delay, a numbering will be attributed to each card **randomly**, not dependent on the order they entered that pool.
- Crafting
  - The crafting will be **opened** for Mantris cards on `2023-11-30 14:00 UTC`!
  - Numbering pool will be in place until `2023-12-04 14:00 UTC`.
- Adventure
  - We improved performance in the energy refill window.
- Play
  - We added an outline on numbers in buffs icons (fields, Shift SA) to better visualize the turn remaining.

## 0.17.7207 Patch

`2023-11-21 14:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Play
  - SA: Banner of command
    - Removed the power bonus on the leader to avoid overpowered leaders.
    - Full description: As long as you control your Leader on the board, all the other battle cards you control of the same Trait are empowered by +45 power. Each battle card of the same Trait as your Leader has a deck cost reduction of -10.
  - SA: Draw Refill
    - Added 1 draw counter at the start of the duel and added the refill of the draw counter with the amount of cards captured directly by the Leader.
    - Full description: You start the game with 3 draw counters. When played, your leader makes you both draw and increase your draw counter of the amount of cards he directly captured (does not apply to chain captures).
  - There will not be any other balancing changes until Act 2.
- Shop
  - Following community feedback, we are making some adjustments to Mantris collection series:
    - We are making the series being released faster (2 weeks instead of 1 month), their duration are 6 weeks.
    - In the near future, we will be adding both a limited discount system and bonus content whenever you buy a large amount of packs from the shop. As a result, we are delaying the end of the Hassan series so everyone will be able to benefit on this series too.
    - Hassan series is being prolonged until December 20th (8 weeks total).
    - Arhax series will start November 22nd and will end on January 3rd (6 weeks total).
    - Shakti series will start December 6th and will end on January 17th (6 weeks total).

## 0.17.6985 Hotfix 1

`2023-10-26 13:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Trisel Rewards
  - Trisel base gain has been increased by 300%. Computation for a win was `Score / 2` capped at 35. It is now `Score * 2` capped at `100`.
  - In normal game, you only earn 75% of this formula.
  - As a reminder, this formula is true for a win or a draw and before any multiplier (based on your rating or a bonus).
  - Whenever you lose, if it is a surrender or timeout, this value is divided by 3 otherwise it is divided by 1.5.
  - If you have a high rating (currently it uses the rating of the last era while ranked games are disabled), this value can be multiplied by up to 50%.
  - In order to celebrate the launch of Mantris and until new relics are out, we apply a bonus multiplier that increases the rewards by 100%.
- Trisel Rewards Cap
  - The cap is rolling over 28 days but the limit used to increase daily (500 x28 before Mantris, 1500 x28 since then as long as you log in every day for a total of 42000 over 28 days).
  - We are moving this increase to every week, meaning you only need to log-in one time every 7 days to increase your rolling limit by 10000.
  - This value can also be multiplied by 50% based on your rating (scales linearly).
  - Trisel bonus multipliers (such as the one we are enabling for Mantris until relics are out) also apply. It means that until relics, the maximum theoretical cap is 120000 over 28 days if you were Champion in the last era, 80000 over 28 days if you were Bronze.
- Mission
  - As explained in `0.17.6985 Patch`, all General Missions rewards now have been replaced with Card Shards.

### Fixes

- Mantris PreSale Packs
  - Cards being displayed as flex are now correctly minted, they were in a pending mint state. Order of mint is the same as the opening.
  - As a clarification due to many questions in this regards, here is how the Orion unique card works: odds are 1 out of 10000 for the first 10000 packs. After this, the odds increase to 1 out of remaining packs, up until 1 out of 1 for the last pack (meaning it is guaranteed to be drawn). To compensate for this system, the first 10000 packs have a bonus foil odds up to the double amount of what is normally possible (between 10% and 20%, not counting the guaranteed foils).

## 0.17.6985 Patch

`2023-10-25 06:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Mantris season
  - Season 2: Mantris is here! You will be able to open your presale packs on `2023-10-25 16:00 UTC`. This season will feature up to 225 cards with 165 available right away.
  - By opening a presale pack, you will be automatically eligible to receive your Cross The Ages Land ticket. Later in the year, we'll send you as many tickets as you've opened packs. They will be sent to the game wallet of the account on which they were opened.
  - The first series of Mantris cards will be available in the shop on `2023-10-25 18:00 UTC` to give you some time to open your presale packs. This pack contains 10 cards with a chance to obtain the first Mythic card: Hassan!
  - A new pack will be available each month featuring a new Mythic card. This series will be available until `2023-11-22 18:00 UTC`. Pity system is as before except it now requires 5 times less packs to reach the end of the stock per mythic series.
  - New packs have been added as rewards for daily & weekly missions and for duel wins. Those packs contain only the cards first released in the shop. It means those packs can contain Static cards up to Mythic rarities! You will be able to open them starting from `2023-10-25 18:00 UTC`.
  - New daily, weekly and general missions have been added with objectives that validate with Mantris cards. It has also been made clearer from which game mode each mission validates.
- Rewards
  - Trisel base gain cap per win has been increased from 35 to 100. Daily limit has been increased from 500 to 1500.
  - Trisel gains are no longer available in Adventure and Daily/Weekly Missions. It has been replaced by cards or card shards. It will partially come back with new relics in a future update. General Missions will follow.
  - Players who had a relic active between 4 Oct and today have been fully refunded (even if you had only 1 day remaining).
- Shop
  - The Arkhante series will be removed from the shop at `2023-10-25 16:00 UTC` to make room for the Mantris series! The display is meant for Mantris packs so you will have to scroll a little bit for Arkhante chests.
- Account
  - Verifying your account is now mandatory in order to interact with the blockchain to mint or craft a card.
  - We previously announced the minimum amount of CTA tokens to interact will be raised to 100, this has been postponed following account merge as cap will be modified. More on this during the November update.
- Collection
  - Types of cards have been renamed to allow for better communication:
    - Eternal cards (cards you gained from playing the game) are now Static cards. Those cards cannot be minted and thus traded.
    - Digital cards (cards you obtained from opening chests from the shop) are now Flex cards.
    - NFT cards (cards that have been minted) are now Eternal cards.
  - Arkhante and Mantris default card back have been updated/added.
  - You can now see every card from the game in a loading screen including their combo variation.
- Play
  - New animations have been added in duels for Special Abilities.
- Heptagram
  - The heptagram has been revamped to welcome Mantris. Keep in mind it will be updated early next year following gameplay changes after the Heroes Legacy tournament.
