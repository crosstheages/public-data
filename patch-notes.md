### Changes

- Collection
  - Simplified the card detail and show directly the Footer instead of having to swipe from the bottom or click the arrow at the bottom.

  - Added a Foil toggle on the product detail to switch between the Foil version of a card and its non-Foil version.
  - Limited the number of cards taken by the shred duplicate functionality to 10 000 cards at a time. If you want to shred more than that, you will have to shred duplicates multiple times. This is to alleviate server load when shredding cards. (Available with next server restart)

  - Fixed some white artifacts on some cards with parallax skin.

## 0.23.11206 Patch

`2024-09-25 06:00 PM UTC`

### Changes

- Rift season
  - Season 3: Birth of Rift is here! You will be able to open your presale packs on `2024-09-26 06:00 PM UTC`. This season will feature up to 210 cards with 152 available right away.
  - Pack of Rift cards will be available in the shop on `2024-09-25 06:00 PM UTC` to give you some time to open your presale packs.
  - This season, you can also buy Ultra, Omega or Neo boxes that contain respectively 120, 240 and 480 Rift Cards. Those packs also come with an Exclusive card. The advancement, rank and grade of the card is random and determined the moment you buy a box. This Exclusive card will change every month. This month features Gravowl!
  - You will be able to mint these cards directly but the numbering for all Rift cards will not be determined until `2024-10-04 08:00 AM UTC`.
  - A whole new batch of missions have been added and all the missions will give Rift shards, cards or Packs. Unlocker, Arena duels and Adventure challenges now award Rift shard, cards or packs.
  - The Mantris series have been removed from the shop to make room for the Rift series! 
- New items
  - We added a new currency named Ark. Ark is exclusively a free to play currency. It is gained abundantly from playing the game everywhere, collecting cards, reading about their lore. It is used to craft Static cards and buy card skins.
  - We also added Static and Eternal stones. Those stones are used to upgrade cards and create new ones in the Forge. You will be able to Shred cards to obtain stones depending on their Blockchain state (Shredding static cards give static stones ; Shredding Flex or Eternal cards give eternal stones).
  - Both those items are available to be bought in the shop. You will also be able to trade Eternal Stones for Static Stones, and Trisel for Ark.
- New collection display
  - We completely reworked the way you look at your collection. It puts the focus on the art of the cards and will improve the accessibility of the craft by incorporating it directly into the card details.
  - We regrouped all cards into their respective set that contains all the classic cards of it. For each set, you will also be able to look at the Prestige version of the set containing all Special Rare, Exclusive and Unique cards of this Set.
  - In the same spirit as on the portal, when accessing the details of a card, you will first access the product version where you will be able to appreciate it full screen, apply a skin to all the versions of this card and read a bit of lore from this card. And then via the card stack, you will be able to access the details of a particular card to craft it.
  - Rift cards also come with beautiful new ways of enjoying the visuals of it. Firstly, the Foil effect has been reworked to be way more integrated into the art style of the cards. Secondly, a new type of skin has been added to be bought with Ark that enables a parallax effect to the card that adds depth to the Art!
  - The skin system is a new system introduced with this new collection. When you buy a skin for a card with Ark, you now buy it for every version of this card and not only for a specific one. For example, if you buy the Parallax skin of the Isalys standard card, you will be able to apply it to every copy of Isalys standard you own.
  - The craft system will arrive in a few weeks when everyone has been able to get their share of Rift cards.
    - Until it arrives, to make sure you have enough Trisel to upgrade all your cards, we have enabled a 50% boost to all Trisel gains until crafting is available!
  - The Forge is a new system that allows you to craft new Static or Eternal Cards. For static cards, you will only need Static Stones. For Flex cards, you will need Static stones and a Flex Roll (randomly gained from the Leaderboard and from the VIP system).
  - We removed the Bonus Roll functionality for Rift. If you have completed (10 packs of Flex cards opened), that you didn't claim, it has been automatically sent to your inbox. Not completed bonus roll will be lost.
  - You will now find completion targets for each set of cards. These objectives are validated as you collect new cards. Be careful though, if you sell or shred cards, you may lower your completion percentage and lose these rewards.
  - We have renamed some cards to better fit the Lore of the books. 
- Ranked season
  - A new Ranked season has started. We applied a soft reset to every player's rank: at the start of the new era, you will start two ranks below your current rank. (Bronze, Silver and Gold -> Bronze, Platinum -> Silver, Diamond -> Gold, Gladiator -> Platinum, Champion -> Diamond)
  - The Trisel multiplier for all ranks also applies to Ark gains.
  - We added Flex Rolls as rewards for Gladiator's and Champions and removed Flex packs and Flex cards so all flex rewards come from the Forge. 
  - New Ultra Rare and Mythic Shards of the Rift season are available as Leaderboard rewards. They will be able to be combined at a later date. 
- Rift Raids
  - Raids also get their own Rift version! You will face Powerful Rift cards and be able to earn Rift cards, Trisel, Ark and Gaming Points.
- We increased the odds of Static shards, Static packs so they are the same as their Flex counterparts.
