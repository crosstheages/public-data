## 0.18.7474 Patch

`2023-11-29 08:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Leaderboard
  - **Season 2 Era 1 (S2E1) has started** with significant changes to how the Leaderboard works.
  - We've removed the weekly and general points system to give greater focus to your rank.
  - Two new ranks have been added: **Gladiator** and **Champion**. Among the Diamond players, the top 10 will be Champion rank and the next 100 will be Gladiator.
  - Rewards have been revamped and weekly rewards are now common to all members of the same rank. The following rewards will be distributed in total for the era:
    - Champion: 24,000 Trisel, 96 reward packs, 52 shards of exclusive UR card, 26 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Gladiator: 21,000 Trisel, 84 reward packs, 38 shards of exclusive UR card, 19 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Diamond: 18,000 Trisel, 72 reward packs, 24 shards of exclusive UR card, 12 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Platinum: 12,000 Trisel, 60 reward packs, 16 shards of exclusive UR card, 8 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Gold: 9,000 Trisel, 48 reward packs, 12 shards of exclusive UR card, 6 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Silver: 6,000 Trisel, 36 reward packs, 10 shards of exclusive UR card, 5 shards of exclusive Mythic card,
    - Bronze: 3,000 Trisel, 24 reward packs, 8 shards of exclusive UR card, 4 shards of exclusive Mythic card.
  - The way we display the leaderboard is being reworked to better show the different rewards for your rank directly in game. Stay tuned!
  - The distribution is split based on the week, weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6 are normal weeks. Weeks 3 and 5 are super weeks. Last week will be the most generous of all weeks.
  - The number of duels required to qualify for weekly rewards has been increased, and depends on your rank:
    - Champion, Gladiator and Diamond: 30 duels,
    - Platinum: 15 duels,
    - Gold: 7 duels,
    - Silver: 5 duels,
    - Bronze: 3 duels.
  - Update the formula of rating gain, you basically can now climb (and fall) 2 times faster than before until you are Diamond ~100pts.
  - Bonus Trisel multiplier based on rank have been updated as follow:
    - Champion, Gladiator and Diamond: x1.4 -> x1.5,
    - Platinum: x1.3 -> x1.3 (unchanged),
    - Gold: x1.2 -> x1.15,
    - Silver: x1.1 -> x1.05,
    - Bronze: x1 -> x1 (unchanged).
- Rewards
  - We standardized the cards you obtain by playing the game into one pack. This pack is named **Reward pack** and contains 10 cards from common to mythic. The odds per card compared to before are as follow:
    - Mythic: 0.05% -> 0.20%,
    - Ultra Rare: 0.15% -> 0.80%,
    - Rare: 9.80% -> 7.00%,
    - Uncommon: 30.00% -> 22.00%,
    - Common: 60.00% -> 70.00%,
  - Finishing your daily missions gives you one reward pack containing 10 cards up from 3 cards.
  - Finishing your weekly missions gives you up to 7 reward packs, you can now claim 1, 2 and 4 reward packs at each threshold for a total of 70 cards up from 15 cards.
  - End of duel packs are now reward packs, but still have to go through the unlocker first. The packs contain 10 cards up from 2 cards and takes 12 hrs to unlock up from ~4.5 hours.
  - Weekly dungeons now give up to 7 reward packs based on the number of stars you achieve for a total of 70 cards up from 12 cards.
  - Rewards from 1, 2 and 3 stars of repeatable dungeons have been revamped with the most notable change being a reduction of the shards obtained and now a random card up to mythic for all dungeons instead of the last one only.
  - Shards combine odds have been updated too, here are the new ones:
    - Mythic: 0.05% -> 0.10%,
    - Ultra Rare: 0.15% -> 0.40%,
    - Rare: 9.80% -> 7.50%,
    - Uncommon: 30.00% -> 22.00%,
    - Common: 60.00% -> 70.00%.
  - Rewards from missions have also been adjusted due to the drop rate changes with a reduction in shard to compensate for the new amount of cards in reward packs.
  - Daily/weekly missions and repeatable dungeons now give Mantris card shards instead of Arkhante.
  - UI reworks
    - We reworked the inventory to better show each section. We split the unlocker and inventory in three separate tabs: Unlocker, Inventory and Shards.
      - Unlocker
        - You now have a number of locked packs you can **store** when your unlocker is full, up to 8 slots (with a Sapphire relic).
        - We also **reduced** the number of **unlock slot** available, removing the level 20 slot and the 50 unlock slot, from 6 to 4 maximum (with a Sapphire relic).
      - Inventory
        - Show all **chests, packs, pranah bundle, free mint, mint pass** you have. You can better see each of these items individually, see all odds related to each chests, ...
      - Shards
        - Show all the **shards** you have. You can filter them out by Season or Nature, Open or Mint multiple at a time, better see the odds related to that shard.
    - Following the rework of the Merge, we also reworked the user experience for the Power up and the Awakening!
      - Power-up & Awakening
        - Entire **UI remake** so it's smoother and easier to see the different outcomes.
      - Merge
        - Added an **Auto-fill** functionality that will automatically fill all the reagent cards with the lowest grade card you have.
    - We remade the display of **patch notes** to make them more readable and facilitate the navigation between different patches.
    - We added a display for the **maximum amount of Trisel** a player can earn from PvP duels in the tooltip of Trisel on the dashboard (the cap was already in place but we just added the display of it).
    - We added a display for the **current exp** you are at and the total amount of exp necessary to level up in the tooltip of Experience on the dashboard.
- Relics
  - **Relics** will be back on `2023-12-04 14:00 UTC`!
  - They received a whole rework and offer now **multiple bonuses**:
    - More slots to unlock packs (up to 3 additionals based on relic),
    - More slots to store unlocked packs (up to 6 additionals based on relic),
    - Auto-unlock and claim of unlocker packs,
    - Flex Cards in reward packs and leaderboard (up to mythic based on relic),
    - Flex Shards in dungeons and daily/weekly missions (up to mythic for every relic),
    - Queue multiple repeatable dungeons at a time,
    - AutoBattle option for repeatable dungeons (only with Amethyst and Sapphire Relic),
    - Battle Speed-Up x2 option for repeatable dungeons (only with Sapphire Relic),
    - Bonus damage per capture in repeatable dungeons (up to +20 based on relic),
    - Bonus Trisel on repeatable dungeons and daily/weekly missions (up to 7x amount of shards based on relic)
    - Bonus Trisel in reward packs (up to 77 based on relic),
    - Reductions in energy refill cost increase (up to 400 based on relic),
    - They now last **15 days** and are available in **three tiers** that offers those bonuses but at different degrees.
- Eternal
  - As previously discussed, we decided to change the way we manage **numbering** in the early moments of the release of new cards (pack opening, new crafts available, exclusive cards from events, ...) to be more fair to everyone.
  - With this update, for a **few days** following the release of new cards, the creation of a new Eternal card will not allocate a number at first but instead, register the creation in a pool. At the end of the delay, a numbering will be attributed to each card **randomly**, not dependent on the order they entered that pool.
- Crafting
  - The crafting will be **opened** for Mantris cards on `2023-11-30 14:00 UTC`!
  - Numbering pool will be in place until `2023-12-04 14:00 UTC`.
- Adventure
  - We improved performance in the energy refill window.
- Play
  - We added an outline on numbers in buffs icons (fields, Shift SA) to better visualize the turn remaining.

### Fixes

- Duel
  - Fixed capture indicator display not updating correctly in some rare cases.
  - Fixed score indicator not being displayed on mobile.

  - Fixed foil cards not being displayed correctly.

## 0.17.7207 Patch

`2023-11-21 14:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Play
  - SA: Banner of command
    - Removed the power bonus on the leader to avoid overpowered leaders.
    - Full description: As long as you control your Leader on the board, all the other battle cards you control of the same Trait are empowered by +45 power. Each battle card of the same Trait as your Leader has a deck cost reduction of -10.
  - SA: Draw Refill
    - Added 1 draw counter at the start of the duel and added the refill of the draw counter with the amount of cards captured directly by the Leader.
    - Full description: You start the game with 3 draw counters. When played, your leader makes you both draw and increase your draw counter of the amount of cards he directly captured (does not apply to chain captures).
  - There will not be any other balancing changes until Act 2.
- Shop
  - Following community feedback, we are making some adjustments to Mantris collection series:
    - We are making the series being released faster (2 weeks instead of 1 month), their duration are 6 weeks.
    - In the near future, we will be adding both a limited discount system and bonus content whenever you buy a large amount of packs from the shop. As a result, we are delaying the end of the Hassan series so everyone will be able to benefit on this series too.
    - Hassan series is being prolonged until December 20th (8 weeks total).
    - Arhax series will start November 22nd and will end on January 3rd (6 weeks total).
    - Shakti series will start December 6th and will end on January 17th (6 weeks total).

## 0.17.6985 Hotfix 1

`2023-10-26 13:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Trisel Rewards
  - Trisel base gain has been increased by 300%. Computation for a win was `Score / 2` capped at 35. It is now `Score * 2` capped at `100`.
  - In normal game, you only earn 75% of this formula.
  - As a reminder, this formula is true for a win or a draw and before any multiplier (based on your rating or a bonus).
  - Whenever you lose, if it is a surrender or timeout, this value is divided by 3 otherwise it is divided by 1.5.
  - If you have a high rating (currently it uses the rating of the last era while ranked games are disabled), this value can be multiplied by up to 50%.
  - In order to celebrate the launch of Mantris and until new relics are out, we apply a bonus multiplier that increases the rewards by 100%.
- Trisel Rewards Cap
  - The cap is rolling over 28 days but the limit used to increase daily (500 x28 before Mantris, 1500 x28 since then as long as you log in every day for a total of 42000 over 28 days).
  - We are moving this increase to every week, meaning you only need to log-in one time every 7 days to increase your rolling limit by 10000.
  - This value can also be multiplied by 50% based on your rating (scales linearly).
  - Trisel bonus multipliers (such as the one we are enabling for Mantris until relics are out) also apply. It means that until relics, the maximum theoretical cap is 120000 over 28 days if you were Champion in the last era, 80000 over 28 days if you were Bronze.
- Mission
  - As explained in `0.17.6985 Patch`, all General Missions rewards now have been replaced with Card Shards.

### Fixes

- Mantris PreSale Packs
  - Cards being displayed as flex are now correctly minted, they were in a pending mint state. Order of mint is the same as the opening.
  - As a clarification due to many questions in this regards, here is how the Orion unique card works: odds are 1 out of 10000 for the first 10000 packs. After this, the odds increase to 1 out of remaining packs, up until 1 out of 1 for the last pack (meaning it is guaranteed to be drawn). To compensate for this system, the first 10000 packs have a bonus foil odds up to the double amount of what is normally possible (between 10% and 20%, not counting the guaranteed foils).

## 0.17.6985 Patch

`2023-10-25 06:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Mantris season
  - Season 2: Mantris is here! You will be able to open your presale packs on `2023-10-25 16:00 UTC`. This season will feature up to 225 cards with 165 available right away.
  - By opening a presale pack, you will be automatically eligible to receive your Cross The Ages Land ticket. Later in the year, we'll send you as many tickets as you've opened packs. They will be sent to the game wallet of the account on which they were opened.
  - The first series of Mantris cards will be available in the shop on `2023-10-25 18:00 UTC` to give you some time to open your presale packs. This pack contains 10 cards with a chance to obtain the first Mythic card: Hassan!
  - A new pack will be available each month featuring a new Mythic card. This series will be available until `2023-11-22 18:00 UTC`. Pity system is as before except it now requires 5 times less packs to reach the end of the stock per mythic series.
  - New packs have been added as rewards for daily & weekly missions and for duel wins. Those packs contain only the cards first released in the shop. It means those packs can contain Static cards up to Mythic rarities! You will be able to open them starting from `2023-10-25 18:00 UTC`.
  - New daily, weekly and general missions have been added with objectives that validate with Mantris cards. It has also been made clearer from which game mode each mission validates.
- Rewards
  - Trisel base gain cap per win has been increased from 35 to 100. Daily limit has been increased from 500 to 1500.
  - Trisel gains are no longer available in Adventure and  Daily/Weekly Missions. It has been replaced by cards or card shards. It will partially come back with new relics in a future update. General Missions will follow.
  - Players who had a relic active between 4 Oct and today have been fully refunded (even if you had only 1 day remaining).
- Shop
  - The Arkhante series will be removed from the shop at `2023-10-25 16:00 UTC` to make room for the Mantris series! The display is meant for Mantris packs so you will have to scroll a little bit for Arkhante chests.
- Account
  - Verifying your account is now mandatory in order to interact with the blockchain to mint or craft a card.
  - We previously announced the minimum amount of CTA tokens to interact will be raised to 100, this has been postponed following account merge as cap will be modified. More on this during the November update.
- Collection
  - Types of cards have been renamed to allow for better communication:
    - Eternal cards (cards you gained from playing the game) are now Static cards. Those cards cannot be minted and thus traded.
    - Digital cards (cards you obtained from opening chests from the shop) are now Flex cards.
    - NFT cards (cards that have been minted) are now Eternal cards.
  - Arkhante and Mantris default card back have been updated/added.
  - You can now see every card from the game in a loading screen including their combo variation.
- Play
  - New animations have been added in duels for Special Abilities.
- Heptagram
  - The heptagram has been revamped to welcome Mantris. Keep in mind it will be updated early next year following gameplay changes after the Heroes Legacy tournament.

  - Added an option to make a custom game lobby with tournament restrictions (which does not allow Eternal cards). We are aware of a potential issue on mobile regarding app switch while a lobby is created, we recommend using the desktop version for any tournament to ensure a smooth experience.
- Missions
  - The 'Win X duels' no longer take into account dungeons from Adventure mode. This is a temporary disable, more on this for season 2 'Mantris' release.

  - Fixed an issue with merge crafting where the background of the screen could show up when launching a duel.

## 0.16.6753 Patch

`2023-10-11 12:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Crafting
  - Reworked the merge screen to allow merges with more than 2 cards. You now have to select the Combo you want to craft, and then select the cards that you want to add in the craft of the combo.
  - This is just a first step: The power-up and Awakening will be reworked in the same style.
- Adventure Mode
  - Added Recommanded deck power on the Dungeon selection screen to give a better idea of what you need to have to win that duel.
  - The tab you were at is now remembered when leaving the Adventure mode and you directly go to that tab when re-entering the Adventure mode.
- Cards
  - Animation Levels
    - Due to technical constraints, we are reducing the total number of animation levels from 5 to 3. As such, we are removing the current Animation Level 1 and are giving for free to everyone what used to be Animation Level 2. We are doing the same with Animation Level 2 and 3, which means that if you bought the Level 2 previously you directly get what used to be the Level 3 ! The old Level 4 (new Level 3) will be available after Mantris.
    - Examples :
      - I previously had a card with Animation Level 1 -> I have the same card that is still Animation Level 1 but the art is the old Animation Level 2.
      - I previously had a card with Animation Level 2 -> I have the same card that is still Animation Level 2 but the art is the old Animation Level 3.
  - Updated the Artwork for 3 standard field cards (Alvilid (133), Acongua (134) and Nepthys (136))

## 0.16.6594 Patch

`2023-10-04 15:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Adventure Mode
  - We are thrilled to announce the addition of Adventure mode to Cross The Ages: Trading Card Game. In Adventure you don't play against another player, but against an AI in different levels and setups.
  - This mode will facilitate access to the game for new players by offering an easy-to-approach mode, with a multi-step tutorial and application exercises to help you understand the game. This mode also introduces "Eternal" cards, which you can earn in this mode, but which cannot be crafted or minted. By introducing cards that cannot be altered, we're able to give you many more of them, and in higher rarity! You'll be able to get Mythic, Alternative, Ultra Rare or Combo cards straight away!
  - In adventure mode, you don't score points, but you do take life points away from your opponent! At the start of the duel, each player has a given number of life points, and each time a capture is made, the power difference between the two cards is deducted from the opponent's life gauge. This mechanic is specific to Adventure mode, and the score system is retained in Arena mode, where you face off against other players.
  - In Adventure mode, decks are simplified: they contain only 15 cards (1 Leader, 2 field cards and 12 battle cards), and have no Special Ability or power limit! Throw all the power you've got at the various levels available, but bear in mind that this isn't necessarily the best solution!
  - Adventure mode is also an opportunity for us to improve the way you learn to play Cross The Ages: Trading Card Game. The tutorial has been divided into several parts and serves as an introduction to each chapter of the Story mode. You'll learn how to play the game step-by-step in different scenarios, so you can get the grip on all the basics of the game.
  - You'll then be able to tackle various dungeons that will allow you to earn rewards repeatedly every day, thanks to an energy system. Facing a dungeon costs 10 energy. You have an energy cap of 100, and you regain 10 every 2 hours (and 30 when you gain a level).
  - Every week, you can face a challenge to win new rewards! The weekly dungeon is made up of 3 duels that you'll have to chain one after the other, and the reward will depend on your performance in these duels.
  - A final mode lets you train infinitely and earn Eternal card shards to expand your collection.
  - Throughout Adventure mode, all the cards and card shards you earn are Eternal (formerly known as "Training" cards). This means that these cards cannot be Minted (and therefore cannot be traded on the blockchain), and cannot be upgraded through crafting. In some game modes, you earn shards of Eternal cards. These can be combined to create Eternal cards. A rework of the inventory screen is on the way to facilitate the combination of newly added shards.
  - Daily, weekly and general missions can be completed in dungeons, except missions tied to scoring, Special abilities, or duels.
  - Of course, this is just the beginning of Adventure mode! More levels to come, new modes, new dungeons, ...
- Arena mode
  - Affixes are removed in Normal and Ranked mode. They provided a variety of changes, made to make every duel feel different while grinding the ladder. With the arrival of the Adventure mode, we don't need that system in the Arena mode. You can still experience them in custom mode and who knows, they may surprise you in the Adventure mode!
  - We've also added a much-requested feature: duels against an AI! You can come and test your new decks without any consequences against an AI that will adapt to your various moves. It will be improved over time to provide you with a challenging experience. For the moment, only one difficulty level is available. The AI deck adapts in terms of power to what you may have in your collection, to ensure a fair duel.
  - For new players, the Adventure mode will be mandatory before entering the Arena: you will first have to do all the intro of the Story mode to get enough knowledge of the game before fighting other players. You will then have to duel the IA to unlock Normal mode, and finally some game in Normal mode to unlock Ranked mode. Although keep in mind that Ranked mode is disabled until the new season.
    - End of duel chests
    - Changed the chest that you get at the end of a duel to always be the Tier 2 chest (6 hours unlock).
    - This chest will now reward Eternal cards. In the future, using relics you will be able to make them digital again if you have an active relic during the unlock process.
    - We removed the possibility to recycle those chests to offset the amount of Trisel that you gain from Adventure mode.
    - You will have a slight chance to receive a chest from doing dungeons in the PvE mode.
  - End of era rewards
    - Season 1 Era 7 (S1E7) has ended and corresponding rewards have been sent. Reminder that end of era rewards a bit less than the previous Era because it accounts for a part of the rewards being sent weekly.
- Inbox
  - We added a new system to better communicate with you and send you your gifts: the Inbox system.
  - The inbox is accessible right on the dashboard and you will be able to see what gifts you receive from the CTA team.
  - This includes: Info about new events, new chests, info about the current era, your end of era rewards, Airdrops, ...
  - Also included: When you forgot to claim your daily or weekly mission chest, it will automatically be sent to you in the mailbox! Be careful thought, you will only be able to claim it for 1 week after the reset, not more.
- Reworks
  - Custom Lobby rework
    - Another rework is the Custom Lobby: The UI has been completely redone to be easier to read and to set up duels with your friend.
    - On this screen, you will also be able to invite spectators that will be allowed to watch your duel from the point of view of either of the players. He will obviously not be able to interact with the duel in any way.
  - Reworked the way the card detail is displayed in the collection and while in a duel.
- Miscellaneous
  - You will now need to be level 10 to Mint a card.
  - With the amount of cards you will receive in the PvE mode, there is no more need for rotation cards and they have consequently been removed.
  - Changed all cards that you gain from chests that you get by playing the game (welcome chest, daily, weekly and general mission chests) to award Eternal cards.
  - Added German and Italian localization.
  - Various terms of the game have been renamed to better fit the lore of Cross the Ages (Prana to Pranah, Arkhome/Element to Trait, in french Abilité Spéciale to Technique Spéciale).

- Account management
  - Anonymous
    - A new way to enjoy Cross The Ages! You are no longer required to register to start to play! When first launching the app, you will be asked if you want to play directly or create an account or sign in.
    - When playing on an anonymous account, you are able to enjoy all the gameplay of Cross The Ages , but some features are blocked such as all the interactions with the blockchain, ranked leaderboard and end of era rewards. Upon registering, you will receive a welcome gift with some cards and Trisel.
  - Account switching
    - For players that enjoy the game on multiple accounts, we made it easier to switch between different accounts! When you successfully log in an account, the session is stored on the device and you are now able to easily switch between all logged in accounts on the device. Keep in mind that logging in this account on another device will expire the session.
    - To access this functionality, just after the login window, in the top left of the account screen, you have a dropdown with all the accounts you have logged in on this device. And you can also add new accounts.
    - After this update, you will have to log again onto all your accounts.
  - Settings shared to device
    - All settings are now shared between all accounts on the device.
- Leaderboard
  - Season 1 Era 1-5 (S1E1 to S1E5) Argonath & Solis shards have been sent retroactively.
  - For Season 1 Era 4 (S1E4), a bonus of 1 Solis shard and 1 Argonath shard have been sent to top 384 and 768 respectively as a compensation of the recently highest rating confusion.
  - Season 1 Era 6 (S1E6) has ended and corresponding rewards have been sent. Reminder that in case players have the same amount of points, the order is given by who ranked the best on average in previous weeks, and then by highest recent rating, and finally by who reached that highest first.
  - Season 1 Era 7 (S1E7) has started with a notable change regarding the decay. It has been removed, you now have an amount of games to play each week to validate your weekly rating based on your previous week rank. For the first week, you only need 1 game. As a reference, here are the requirements:
    - 1st-64th: 10 games / week
    - 65-128th: 7 games / week
    - 129-256th: 3 games / week
    - 257th+: 1 game / week

  - It features a fresh event journey with cosmetic rewards and a new exclusive card: Lena!
  - New event missions will be available, they last for the whole event.
  - The principle is the same as the last events: completing daily, weekly and event missions gives you event points to progress in the event journey. Each level reached gives you cosmetics or coins that you can use in the event shop.
  - A new event shop with new cosmetics will be available starting from `2023-08-21 16:00 UTC`.

    - We reworked the layout of the Shop, all cleaned up and re-organised for upcoming items!
    - In the event shop, you will now be able to directly buy multiple items that are stackable (cards, Trisel).
    - Starting with this event, the Event shop will stay open 7 days after the end of the event.
    - In the Arkhante serie: You are now able to reset your serie. As you know, earlier this year we introduced the stock system to the shop. Meaning that cards have a specific amount of personal stock that you can have when buying packs to guarantee you will have all cards after buying sufficient packs. You can look at the state of your serie on the Arkhante collection. You can now reset that stock to start with a fresh stock.
      - Example: You can only have 1 Foil Sarash card within your serie. If you got it by opening your first Neo Plenition, you won't be able to get it until you run out of stock for all your other cards. With the Reset, you are able to fill up all the stock, and you might be able to get another Foil Sarash on your next Omega if you are lucky.

## 0.15.5333 Patch

`2023-07-12 08:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Balance
  - SA Field Influence: We reverted the change we made in the previous patch to the Field SA as it was too strong in combination with the field cost changes. We went back to the previous version of the SA with adjusted values.
    - Full text: As long as you control your Leader on the board, empower your field cards by +40 power and weaken opponent's field cards by -30 power.
  - SA Power Mirror: Power mirror is also a SA that we feel is too strong at the start of this era. We are changing it so it can only copy the power of the cards that you own (cards that are in your deck at the start of the duel) on the board.
    - Full text: When played, your Leader copies the nominal power of the most powerful card you own on the board.
    - Note: Own and Control are important notions that we want to normalize for the wording in the game. "Own" is cards that are yours at the start of the duel, and "Control" are cards that are currently under your control on the board. This notion is shown for each card on the board when you show the details of a card (long press or right click on a card).
  - Normal mode rewards: Now that rotation cards are disabled in ranked mode, we feel the normal mode rewards were a bit lackluster for new players as they don't have the choice to play in ranked mode at first. We changed the normal mode rewards so that ranked game rewards are only 33% better than normal mode rewards. Additionally, we wanted to give a new bonus to the event insignia : If you have bought the insignia for the current event, normal duels will now award you with 100% of the event experience you would gain in a ranked duel.
- EthCC Chest
  - Celebrating our EthCC event participation, we will release a special chest containing 3 cosmetics and a new shard starting `2023-07-17 08:00 UTC`.
  - Mint Passes owners will receive some shards for free (same quantity as ruby shards) starting `2023-07-17 08:00 UTC`.
  - You need to combine 20 shards to receive the exclusive Kraken card. Shards are mintable for 0.5$ each. Shards can be combined starting `2023-07-20 08:00 UTC`
  - You cannot mix digital and NFT shards.
  - You can obtain from 1 to 3 shards in each chest.

### Fixes

- UI
  - Fixed a few issues in the Inventory section regarding relics.

## 0.15.5306 Hotfix #1

`2023-06-28 08:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Leaderboard
  - Season 1 Era 5 (S1E5) has ended. This time, players are rewarded based on the amount of points you had in the global leaderboard. In case players have the same amount of points, the order is given by who ranked the best on average in previous weeks, and then by highest recent rating, and finally by who reached that highest first. As a reminder, every reward but shards will be sent for this era, those will be sent on the next era ending (August).

## 0.15.5281 Patch

`2023-06-20 01:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Leaderboard
  - The new Decay system will be implemented in the upcoming era. It was applied for the current Era, but since we did not adequately communicate on it, we have decided to revert it and will return points to those affected by the system, ensuring that the decay will not be applied in future snapshots until the next Era.
  - The decay will work as follow:
    - No decay before 1500 rating
    - Gold (1500 – 1849): 150 rating decay if you haven’t played for more than 7 days
    - Platinum (1850 – 2199): 100 rating decay if you haven’t played for more than 3 days
    - Diamond+ (2200+): 50 rating decay if you haven’t played for more than 1 day
- Gameplay
  - The Score Twist Affix is now permanent in the game. Every duel will have an end score that can be either 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70. The end score to reach will be displayed during the dice roll of affixes at the start and at all times at the top of the board.
  - Affixes
    - Affixes are now unlocked after 10 duels in ranked. You can then train against them in normal duels the same way you would do in ranked duels.
    - Affixes are now less common. You will encounter them on average in 50% of your duels. The probability of having a second affix during a duel is now available for everyone but at low ranking the probability is low. It is more and more present the higher your rating is. Chances of a second affix:
      - Bronze: 2%
      - Silver: 10%
      - Gold: 25%
      - Platinum: 50%
      - Diamond: 75%
      - Master: 100%
    - Affixes are now all in the same pool and can be either the first or the second affix. Some affixes can not be drawn together like Extended Reach and Limited Reach.
    - You can now ban affixes you don't want to play against:
      - In a duel, if one of the players has banned an affix, you won't be able to roll it.
      - You can ban affixes in the game mode selection window.
      - At low ranks, you can ban up to 2 affixes.
      - Starting at gold rating, you can ban only 1 affix.
      - And starting at Platinum rating, you can't ban affixes anymore.
  - Balance
    - Fields
      - Fields penalty power has been redesigned. They now have a flat (Nominal power + 300) penalty power when building your deck.
      - ie: A 50 Nominal power now has a 350 penalty power (was 300 penalty power before). A 140 Nominal power now has a 440 penalty power (was 480 penalty power before).
    - Special Abilities
      - Power Stacking: The SA was reworked to be capped at 725. Also, the amount of power the card gains per turn depends on their rarity and grade (whichever is highest):
        - +20 per turn for a Mythic card or grade S card.
        - +15 per turn for an Special Rare, Ultra Rare card or grade A card.
        - +10 per turn for a Rare card or grade B card.
        - +5 per turn for an Uncommon/Common card or grade C card.
        - Full text: At the end of your turns, as long as you keep your Leader in your hand, empower it according to the highness of his rarity or grade, whichever grants you the higher bonus (between 5 and 20 per turn). The power of the Leader can not exceed 725.
      - Field Influence: The SA was reworked to only debuff the fields of the opponent but by 50 power (was 40). The cost of field cards has been simplified to a flat -50 penalty power.
        - Full text: As long as you control your Leader on the board, weaken the opponent's field cards by -50 power. Also reduce the cost of your field cards by 50.
      - Affinity Reinforcement: The SA was reworked to make it a passive effect that lasts for for whole duration of the duel instead of only on Leader control. To balance it, it was nerfed to +10 power for the first affinity and +5 for each additional affinity (was +15 for the first affinity and +5 for each additional affinity)
        - Full text: Empower each card you control by +10 power for their first affinity, and by +5 power for each additional affinity. This is a passive effect and applies at the start of the duel.
    - Affixes
      - Affinity stacking: Reduced the bonus for each affinity to 15 (was 20).
        - Full text: When a card you control has an affinity for more than a turn, it is empowered by +15 power at the start of each of your turns.
      - Revolution: This affix was reworked to silence the SA for the whole duration of the duel instead of blocking it until turn 7.
        - Full text: At the start of the duel, your Leader is silenced and your Special Ability will not trigger.
  - Animations
    - New design for the dice. Also added a dice to show the draw for Score Twist. During a duel, the score to reach is always displayed on top of the score gauge.
    - New animations for the score after each capture and trinity. The score is updated live with each capture and the score gauge has received an update to its style.
    - An animation has been added when your opponent draws a card next to the score gauge.

## 0.14.4853 Patch

`2023-05-11 14:30 UTC`

### Changes

- MAJOR changes
  - Welcome to the new era, this patch is quite major with some gameplay changes such as decks with 30 cards. We recommend you to read below to get more details!
- Gameplay
  - Deck
    - You now must have 30 cards in your deck for duels. Accordingly, you can have up to 15,000 power and 3 field cards.
    - As such, to help new players complete their decks, we doubled the amount of battle cards you get in the weekly free rotation. We also added 4 fields of 50 powers so you have fields for all the elements. That means you will have 3 powerful fields that match your 3 strongest cards, and 4 basic fields for the rest of the elements.
  - Mulligan
    - At the start of a duel, you can now choose up to 4 cards from your initial hand to discard and draw the amount of card you discarded. The discarded cards are then shuffled in your deck and you can draw them later.
  - Affix
    - Blitz is now 30 seconds to play your turn instead of 24 seconds.
  - Special Abilities
    - Affinity reinforcement: As long as you control your Leader on the board, empower each card you control by +20 power for their first affinity, and by +5 power for each additional affinity (so +20, +25 or +30).
  - Changed the way we manage time remaining for playing. You shouldn't have any more desync with the server that could make you lose by afk while you still had time showing on your screen.
  - Added alerts for when your time is low, especially when the Blitz affix is activated.
- Reborn Event
  - Reborn event starts Friday at `2023-05-12 08:00 UTC`.
  - It features a fresh event journey with cosmetic rewards and new Exclusive cards: Skeleton!
  - New event missions will be available, they last for the whole event.
  - The principle is the same as the last events: completing daily, weekly and event missions gives you event points to progress in the event journey. Each level reached gives you Trisel, cosmetics or points that you can use in the event shop.
  - New for this event: as it does not start on Wednesday, you will get your weekly missions before the start of the event. But do not worry, every mission that you completed before the start of the event will award event points on Friday retroactively!
  - A new event shop with new cosmetics will be available starting from `2023-05-17 16:00 UTC`.
  - Finally, a Neo Reborn Chest will be available in the shop starting from `2023-05-19 16:00 UTC`.
- Leaderboard
  - Season 1 Era 4 (S1E4) has ended. This time, players are rewarded based on their relative rank to others. Here are the rewards you all received depending on your rank:
    - 1st: 2 Neo Chests + 15,120 Pranas + 30,000 Trisels
    - 2nd: Neo Chest + 9,360 Pranas + 25,000 Trisels
    - 3rd: Neo Chest + 4,860 Pranas + 20,000 Trisels
    - 4th: Omega Chest + 4,680 Pranas + 17,500 Trisels

    - Top 10,000: Weekly T2 Chest + 1,000 Trisels
    - Rest: 500 Trisels
  - For Era 5, the system will be a bit different: you will score points every week based on your highest rating of the week. The general ranking of the end of the era will be based on the sum of the points players earned during each week of the era and end of era rewards will be sent according to the general ranking.
  - New UI for the leaderboard. You can switch to the General ranking view and Weekly ranking view in the top left dropdown. You will also be able to view previous weeks results when we advance into the era.
- Game Mode.
  - UI has seen an overhaul.
  - We added an unranked game mode where you will be able play freely, validate missions, earn rewards (experience, Trisel, Event Points but at a reduced rate, i.e. a third of what you earn in ranked mode) without the pressure of the ranking.
  - Note: In a previous communication, we said that Rotation cards will be forbidden from now on in ranked, we do give a grâce period for everyone to switch over. Later in the era, those will be restricted from ranked games.

    - Those missions grant many rewards including cosmetics, deck slots, cards, and of course, Trisel.

    - Some of these missions also unlock functionality such as daily missions (level 2), weekly missions (level 5) and crafting (level 9). It also means that if you didn't reach those levels, you will not have access to these functionality until you reach it.
    - The functionality unlocks when you claim the corresponding mission. It means that after the update, you will have to go to the general mission screen to validate these missions and unlock the functionalities again.
  - Removed the mission "I am the Champion (Era 4)" and added the mission "I am the Champion (Era 5)".
    - The Era 4 mission is still visible for players that earned it during era 4 but you cannot complete it.
    - The points earned for the era 4 mission are not removed but count as "bonus" points toward the maximum of general mission points.
- Pending Burns
  - They now auto-expire after 7 days if you did not complete them in the meantime. In case of an expiration, nothing is refunded so you might lose the Trisel and potentially cards you already burned.
  - You receive 3 email notifications about them (first day, 3rd day, last day).
- UI
  - Added various missing sound effects through the app, test it out!
  - Chests with the new odds system are now mintable.
  - Added a message notifier system on the dashboard, which will be used to warn you about upcoming / important changes.

## 0.9.3431 Patch

`2023-02-10 15:30 UTC`

Disclaimer

Due to API limitations on the IMX side, we have to throttle our usage of the blockchain. As such getting all the NFTs when initializing your wallet can take some time, it is being done as a background task.
Also, whenever you need to burn tokens, it might take up to 1 min to get the information back from IMX, so please wait on the loading screen in-game while we are getting the information. If you cancel it (but your burn all went through), you will still have the content of your chest / the outcome of your card.

### Changes

- Wallet
  - As part of our migration from Stardust to Magic Link, we are now making the CTA Magic Link wallet available and required for any Web3 action.
  - Please see the notes at the end to have a guide based on your use case(s).
  - Using this non-custodial wallet, you can manage your assets however you want. Keep in mind that since it is non-custodial, you have the entire responsibility of your NFT and we will not be able to recover any wrong usage of them on the blockchain.
  - We have removed any plan for Trisel activation fee on transfer EXCEPT on the Minting Pass. Every Minting Pass is automatically activated when you open a PreSale Pack that contains it, although if you transfer it, including selling it, the new owner will have to activate it using Trisel in order to gain its benefit. Although there is no restriction on re-trading.
  - Keep in mind that the Magic Link solution is an intermediate step for us since we are working with Immutable X since the end of 2022 on the [Immutable X Passport](https://www.immutable.com/products/passport) that will be released later this year, CTA will be one of the first game to implement it as it will let many people onboard easily to Web3.
- Marketplace
  - The 3 largest Prana Bundles are now available on the marketplace, listed in USDC, with the same price as what it is in the shop (minus marketplace fee). Once bought, send it to your game wallet and you will be able to open it like a chest to get your Prana.
  - There is no supply for those Bundles, although our community has asked us for a way to make available the card we are releasing in our Prana Physical Collection. As such each card is available with a supply of 1000 and 100 (non-foil / foil respectively) whenever you will redeem it, as a souvenir. There are 10 different cards for each bundle, you get one randomly for each bundle consumed.
  - Those cards cannot be used in-game / in your deck and are purely for the collection.
- Duels
  - You are now warned if you are trying to enter a queue while it's disabled.

### Notes

Here is some guidance about CTA x Magic Link and the use cases in our game:

- I want to **mint / craft / bridge / open NFT**:
  - You need to initialize your Magic Link wallet.
  - Before starting, double check that the email of your game account is the one you want to use.
  - If not, you can change it in-game in your settings.
  - Then simply go to our [Bridge Application](https://bridge.cta-tcg-live.com/).
  - When you log in, you will be prompted with CTA Magic Link wallet initialization.
  - Follow the Magic Link steps.
  - That's it! You're all set up.
  - For burn operation, you will be redirected to Magic Link in order to validate the transaction.
- I want to **buy NFTs on the marketplace** with my **own wallet** (not CTA Magic Link):
  - You do not need Magic Link for that, any IMX-compatible & enabled Wallet will let you go on the marketplaces.
  - Once you have bought the NFTs, if you want to play with them you just have to send it to your CTA Magic Link wallet, its address is displayed on the bridge once initialized.
- I want to **transfer** or **sell** my NFTs:
  - In order to do so, you will have to reveal your private key.
  - Once initialized, click on the "Revel" button in the home page of the Bridge.
  - You will be redirected to the CTA Magic Link Reveal page where you will get your private key.
  - KEEP IN MIND THAT PRIVATE KEY GIVE TOTAL CONTROL OF YOUR WALLET TO ANYONE WITH IT, AS SUCH WE RECOMMEND YOU TO STORE IT SECURELY IF YOU DO SO.
  - Import your private key to any IMX-compatible wallet (GameStop Wallet or MetaMask).
- I want to change my **CTA Magic Link wallet email address**:
  - This use case is not available yet, we expect to release it before the end of February (Change Email).
- I want to **link my own wallet to my game account**:
  - This use case is not available yet, we expect to release it before the end of February (Cold Wallet).

Keep in mind that we are currently reworking our Bridge application to be more than that and be your CTA Account Application.
We will both expand its features as well as its UX/UI.
We are also intending to release our own online Shop (to buy Prana on the web using Credit Card) as well as our own Marketplace with custom display and no marketplace fee.

Fees:

- 2% IMX (protocol)
- 3% CTA (creator)
- x% Marketplace -> this one vary based on the marketplace you are trading

  - New collection: <https://immutascan.io/address/0xa04bcac09a3ca810796c9e3deee8fdc8c9807166>
  - This migration is quite huge as it involves 250k NFT, every NFT is handled automatically except Bored Box which will have a separate way to be migrated.
  - Here is the breakdown of each steps that will be happening in the next following days and weeks:
    - Put the bridge offline.
    - Deploy the new collection and mint every NFT from the Stardust collection (with numbering split).

    - Burn all Stardust NFT except Bored Box
    - Unplug Stardust from the game
    - Put back online the game

      1. Enable mint only (no NFT pack opening nor NFT crafting)
      2. Enable burn (NFT pack opening + NFT crafting)
      3. Re-activate the bridge
      4. Enable Magic Link initialization (put all NFT on player wallet which make transfer and marketplace available by exporting the seed)

    - Note: Your rating was lowered by this change, this is normal as the previous one was over-inflated. Keep in mind that if we did not do that, we would have to increase the threshold of rewards for the majority + draw abusers would get way more rewards than what they deserves.

  - Matchmaking rating widening range is now up to +- 700 before being uncapped (up from 400 before being uncapped).
    - Note: Rating gain is (and always has been) capped at 400 rating diff. So if a player at 1800 plays against someone <= 1400, he will have the same gain/loss as if it was 1400 so does his opponent (his rating +400).

### Changes

- Leaderboard
  - Season 1 Era 1 (S1E1) has ended, here are the rewards you all received depending on the highest rating you reached:
    - 0-1249: 1,000 Trisels
    - 1250-1499: 3,000 Trisels
    - 1500-1849: 7,000 Trisels and a Mega chest
    - 1850-2200: 15,000 Trisels and a Mega chest + an Ultra chest
    - Note: In a previous communication, we said that the first threshold was 1150 but it was incorrect as since it's based on ATH everyone started at 1200, as such it has been put at 1250.
  - In addition to this, the first 10 players who reached 2,000 rating (2k Challenge) received those rewards:
    - 1st: 20,000 Trisels and a Neo chest
    - 2nd: 15,000 Trisels and an Omega chest
    - 3rd: 10,000 Trisels and an Ultra chest
    - 4th to 10th: 5,000 Trisels and a Mega chest
  - New era starting rating is now 1100, as a consequence floor rating for matchmaking is now 1000.
  - Note: End of era rewards will not be based on the highest rating, it will instead be based either on current rating or a new system called "average rating", in any case it will be announced weeks before the end of the next era.
- Gameplay
  - Disclaimer: All the changes below are part of our set of balance changes for the S1E2, although keep in mind that anything can be adjusted in the future.
  - A new system "Affinity Stacking" has been added to the game:
    - After each turn, each card affected by at least an affinity will gain +10 power.
    - Losing one affinity does not reset this bonus, losing all of them does.
    - Capture does also reset the affinity stacking bonus.
  - Special Abilities
    - We are renaming "Special Attack" to "Special Abilities" as some of them are not directly related to Attack.
    - Affinities Reinforcement
      - New SA: "As long as you own your Leader on the board, every card you own with at least one affinity has a power up of +20."
      - Note: This bonus is independent from the "Affinity Stackig" system.
    - Shift Advantages
      - New SA: "When played, your Leader shifts the Arkhomes advantages, +150 becomes -150 and vice-versa. Lasts 3 turns."
    - Banner of Command
      - Buff: "As long as you own your Leader on the board, empower the Leader by +15 and all owned cards of the same Arkhome as your Leader by +45."
    - Field Influence
      - Buff: "As long as you own your Leader on the board, empower your field cards by +50 and weaken opponent field cards by -40. Your fields have -100 deck costs."
    - Power Stacking
      - Nerf: "For each turn elapsed and while you keep your Leader in your hand, its power is increased by +10 per turn."
      - Note: Previously the power increase was effective starting from turn 1 or 2, now it's from turn 3 or 4.
- Duel
  - All alert sounds have been updated (matchmaking, first and second alert for AFK / Timeout).
  - Coin toss bad luck protection no longer takes into account more than 2 games.
    - Note: Since our matchmaking does not consider your history of coin toss, reducing the number of games that weigh the toss reduces the probability of big streaks. In the future (when more players will be playing) we might revisit this system by adding it as a condition to match players together.
  - Leader Arkhome is now shown in the header with its usual icon.
  - Some effect durations have been shortened in order to speed up games.
    - Note: We are continuously working on in-game effects and planning to add new effects / rework some effects. As such some duration might be adjusted when such updates will come out.
  - A new outcome for a game has been added, before whenever the game ended by a 50/50 the lowest remaining time player would lose. We changed this behavior for ranked games as such:
    - Whenever a 50/50 happens, both players earn a reward chest and they split Trisels (15 Trisels each baseline).
    - If both players have a big enough rating difference, the highest rated player has no change on its rating, the lowest rated player does earn half the rating gain he would have earned on a win.
    - If both players are close enough in rating, no changes are made to their rating.
  - Trisel and Exp gains have been adjusted to let you earn more under some circumstances:
    - You get an extra 10 Trisel / 100 EXP if you own more than 90% of the board on a win.
- Mission
  - Missions are now randomly chosen from a pool for each player.
  - We added two new types of missions, playing and winning with a leader of a given Arkhome, available both daily and weekly.
- Cards
  - Free rotations are now randomly chosen from a given pool for each player.
    - Note: We are still iterating on this, both in terms of the number of cards but also what cards. Expect some changes in the upcoming weeks in this regard.
- Dashboard
  - Player name is now shown in the header.
  - Added a logout entry on the burger menu.
- Profile
  - Grayed out unavailable social accounts link (Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter).
- History
  - Leader Arkhome is now displayed.
  - Duel date is now displayed.
  - Added draw outcome and updated some texts.
- Heptagram
  - Is now permanently displayed in every menu while on desktop layout. You can still toggle settings while in-game if needed.
  - If Shift Advantages SA is played, the Heptagram will be shifted while the effect is active.
- Loot
  - No longer show a blank screen but a wait screen if you skip the opening and not all packs are ready to be opened.

### Fixes

  - Improved animation performances.
- Profile
  - Fixed an issue preventing the profile to be opened.

### Notes

- All the visual details are being polished for every resolution, no need to report them at this moment.

## 0.2.6 Patch

`2022-11-17 05:00 UTC`

### Changes

- Duels
  - Trisel and Exp gains have been adjusted to let you earn more under some circumstances:
    - You get more Trisel and EXP on your wins based on your rating. Thresholds are at 1150 / 1500 / 1850 / 2200 / 2550. For each threshold you have +5 Trisel / +50 EXP per win.
  - Matchmaking now has a floor rating of 1000. It means that every player below 1000 rating is considered at 1000 for matchmaking purpose.
    - Note: This change is mandatory in order to maintain the integrity of the economy as some users were purposely losing on their accounts in order to be matched against themselves in very low elo. Hundreds of thousands of Trisel has been earned that way.
    - We have temporarily banned those accounts and removed all EXP/Trisel gains, if the Trisel were already spent, the balance will be negative and they will have to earn back everything.
    - Keep in mind that we banned only accounts that abused the system, if you did encounter your other account only a few times you have not been banned. Keep in mind that this is still against the fairness rules and further measures might be taken against such behavior in the future.
  - Timeout and Surrender rules have been revisited as follow:
    - If you surrender before or during Turn 10, it is considered as an Early Surrender.
    - Games have a duration of 5mins although each turn has now a maximum duration of 2mins, if the player does not end his turn (by playing a battle card) during those 2mins, he will lose the game as it is considered being AFK.
    - Being AFK or making an early surrender triggers a matchmaking penalty that prevents you from queuing for a certain amount of time.
    - This time exponentially increases on each penalty. It is reset weekly.
    - Before making an early surrender, a window pop-up warns you about it.
    - After not playing the turn for 1 min, a 60s countdown appears below the player. If it reaches 0, the game is lost for the AFK player.
      - Note: Disconnects are not fully handled regarding this timer display on the client side, i.e. if you disconnect and reconnect late into a turn you might not see the countdown. This will be fixed in an upcoming update.
    - Surrendering after turn 10 (turn 11 and so on) will not trigger any penalty. Although keep in mind that for missions accomplishment, the win will count as if the opponent controlled 100% of the board.
  - Improved card glow VFX while in hand.
  - Improved card affinities VFX while on the board.

  - Reward chest can now be converted to Trisel instead of being opened at a rate of 1h = 10 Trisel. It means you will not get the cards inside it but Trisel in exchange, this feature is available after the time needed to unlock. All slots (including the free #1 to #3) are eligible for this convert mechanism.
    - Considering we added the reward chest convert feature and that Shop Passes give 3 more unlock slots, there will not be a new daily mission for Shop Passes owners as it is now backed into the convert mechanism.

  - Slot #3 is now enabled after 50 unlock, no matter if you open or convert the chests.

    - +300 experience for a win.

    - Loss with less than 30%, due to timeout, surrender or disconnect does not reward any experience.
  - Coin toss algorithm now uses a cryptographic implementation for its RNG non-subject to modulo bias. What that means is that you are less likely to see a streak.
  - In addition to this, your recent games weigh the coin toss to let you converge to a 50/50 faster in case you were unlucky (bad luck protection system).
    - Note: We are internally iterating on changes to make the difference between starting or not a game less of a burden.

    - Known issue: Some non-foil common cards might not be given as a choice to merge.
