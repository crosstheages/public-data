## 0.1.0.25 patch

`2025-07-28 17:00 UTC`

This patch addresses the issue causing the boss to run indefinitely during certain sequences.

While awaiting the fix, we’ve analyzed the bug’s impact on leaderboard performances. Although it can make high-key boss phases easier, its overall effect on completion time remains limited — thus, triggering it was considered acceptable.

For those curious about standout leaderboard runs: the most notable time differences are mainly due to skilled use of the core snapping mechanic. While difficult to execute and highly risky, it can drastically shorten run durations when used correctly.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the boss could enter an infinite run loop when charging toward the edge of the arena
- Fixed a potential server crash caused by Life Ability 1 if the golem failed to spawn
- Resolved several rare causes of server instability
- Improved unit frame visibility on both creatures and crystals

- AMD RX57.. and RX66..  GPUs fail to render most dungeon textures
