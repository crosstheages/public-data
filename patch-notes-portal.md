### Changes

- Crafting
    - Accessing the Craft :
        - Crafting is exclusively available through the CTA Wallet. If your cards are on the custom wallet, make sure to transfer them to the CTA Wallet beforehand. Head to the Product section to get started. This section will soon evolve into a central hub for managing your assets post-migration. [PRODUCTS](https://portal.crosstheages.com/market/cards/products) You’ll also find the craft feature in the section dedicated to the Eternal Multiplier.
        - Good to Know Before Crafting
        - IMX Processing Time: The process might take a little while. Avoid refreshing the page to prevent interrupting the craft or missing the animation.


    - Card Selection and Management :
        - Choose the minimum quality (foil or non-foil) and the minimum grade for your merges.
        - Compatible cards are selected automatically. If a card exceeds the minimum grade (e.g., Grade A for a minimum of C), you’ll need to select it manually to avoid mistakes.
        - NFT R1 cards are included by default.
        - Quick Purchase: Need a card? Buy it directly at the floor price via the craft pop-up using CTA tokens or USDC.
        - Crafting Alternatives: From a merge, you can now redirect to crafting an alternative (an upgrade to craft without leaving the merge.
        - Visible Results: At the end of the craft, check the card’s current floor price and the crafter’s username displayed on it.

    - Share Your Creations!
        - Show off your crafts to the community and the world via social media!


    - Search:
        - The search system has been completely overhauled to make finding specific cards easier. The search refines results as you type in the search bar.
        - Note: Card names must be entered in the language selected on the portal.

### Fixes

- Search:
    - The name sorting system has been reimplemented. Sorting options are now displayed directly with clear descriptions, removing the need for arrow-based navigation. :
    - Instead of "Sort by name" with an up/down arrow, you now have: 
        - Name (A → Z)
        - Name (Z → A)
